    <h1> Harry Potter </h1>
    <hr>
    <h4>
    Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I love this book, because the author, J.K Rowling drops many clues in every page in the book.
